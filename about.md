The **Kotlin** language was created by JetBrains and released in 2016, having influences from JavaScript, Groovy, Scala and C#. Yes, she is a real Megazord.

The code compiled in Kotlin runs in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), therefore 100% interoperable with Java. This means that you can use traditional Java libraries and frameworks like Spring or Hibernate, and even dependency managers like Maven and Gradle, with ease in a Kotlin project.

With the change adopted by Google, exchanging Java for Kotlin in the Android development pattern, the language ended up becoming popular in the Front-End world. However, Kotlin can be used very easily in the Back-End as well.

The Kotlin language can be summarized as little verbose and simple and concise syntax. As one of the most positive points, the extra concern with Null Safety stands out, being impossible to define a variable with a null value (goodbye nullPointerException), unless it is specified in the declaration, which even generates a certain weight of conscience - or not .

Another strength of Kotlin is the Coroutines, which allow you to write asynchronous code with less complexity.

The **ease of learning** the Kotlin language is a point to be considered in its adoption, especially for developers who already program in Java.

Initially, coding is much more similar to Java, but with time and experience we can use more of the language's resources and create more idiomatic codes for Kotlin.

## Micronaut

Launched in 2018 by Object Computing Inc. (OCi), Micronaut is a framework created with a focus on the development of microservices and, like Kotlin, is based on the JVM.

Micronaut came up with a proposal to minimize the application's memory consumption, reduce startup time and be Cloud Native. Thanks to dependency injection and annotations without using Reflection, Micronaut supports native execution (Grail Vm).

As with Spring, Micronaut delivers to the developer a variety of libraries to reduce time and effort when it comes to integration with other technologies, such as database systems, caching solutions, Kafka, Rest, among others.

Compared to Quarkus, which presents the same proposal, Micronaut stands out for having a little more elaborate documentation, containing several guides with examples of implementations.

Even the learning curve will be smoother if you are arriving from the Spring universe, as Micronaut has abstractions that already follow the pattern of its competitor, in the best “copy, but don't match” style.
